I'm fairly sure that if I did a survey of the features I use, or indeed am even aware of, for pretty much any piece of them I probably wouldn't even hit 50%.

I tend to fall in to a way of working with each that means I can get what I need by doing the same thing each time. This _gets the job done_ but limits the scope for discovering new and potentially time saving methods.

While playing with some designs at a CSS level I came across [Chrome's colour picker contrast ratio feature](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#contrast). It appeared back in January 2018 so it's hardly brand new but unless you avidly follow [Chrome's release notes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/) (which I do not - sorry) you're really only likely to find it when you need it. And I think it's a great idea.

Way back in another life, when CSS (1 that is) had just been born, I worked on a website thast needed to be highly accessible. Unfortunately this is often at odds with stand-out designs. To help with this I created something we named the _accessibility toolbar_ that switched the website to a high contrast yellow and black theme. I learnt a lot along the way and as we aimed to get a [triple AAA accessibility rating](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance) - something easier said than done.
