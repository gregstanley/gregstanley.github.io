I recently had cause to do some work with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) and inevitably ended up spending a lot of time at a command prompt.

Depending on where I am and what I'm trying to achieve I might fire up I might launch the Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell or even Git Bash and often combinations of them all to help distinguish the task form each other. Sure it works but these days I figured there _must_ be a better way. Then I stumbled across [cmder](http://cmder.net/).
What is Cmder?

The definition from the [cmder](http://cmder.net/) home page:

> Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start.

Have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm790AkFeK4) for a quick run through for some insight into why you might want to use it. The [GitHub README](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) is also a good source of tips.

## Why do I like it?

- _Tabbed consoles_ - No more consoles all over the place. Now they're altogether and I can switch between them.
- _Context menu integration (after market!)_ - It doesn't seem to be set up out-of-the box but context menu integration can be added fairly easily (although I had to provide an absolutely path to the exe for it to work).
