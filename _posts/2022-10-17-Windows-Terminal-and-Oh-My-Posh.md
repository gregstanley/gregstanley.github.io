I've used [Cmder](https://cmder.app/) for my Windows command line work for a while now, however, the arrival of [Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/) has made me take another look at this.

[Windows Installation](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows) is easy and with [a little setup](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-make-a-pretty-prompt-in-windows-terminal-with-powerline-nerd-fonts-cascadia-code-wsl-and-ohmyposh) (including [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)) you can have a clear and powerful terminal up and running in no time.

And in case I forget, I created a [custom theme](https://github.com/gregstanley/setup-reference/blob/main/Windows%20Terminal/oh-my-posh-custom-theme-1.omp.json) for [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/).
