With over 15 years of experience in **software engineering**, I specialize in **DevOps, automation, and software development**. My expertise spans **mentoring junior developers**, deployment pipelines, and ensuring **post-deployment validation** through automated processes.

Previously a **Senior Software Engineer**, I’ve contributed to **scalable architectures**, **efficient CI/CD workflows**, and **technical documentation** through blogs and internal wikis. Beyond development, I have a strong background in **coaching** and guiding teams toward best practices.

Now, I’m focused on building my own business, leveraging my technical skills to create innovative solutions.
