I have two primary goals for this site:

1. Act as a central location for capturing notes on the various technologies I use so that I can refer back to it in future.
2. To give myself some kind of presence on the web.

I'm a software engineer by day but after well over a decade of being in and around the industry there is [little to no evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Cb5wQBoXs) of my existence.

Now built using [Jekyll 4](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).
