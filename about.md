I'm a UK based **Software Engineer**. I've been working professionally with all things web and technology since 2006.

I originally started the site in 2019 as, despite being in the industry for over ten yerars, there was [little to no evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Cb5wQBoXs) of my existence.

I have two primary goals for this site:

1. Act as a central location for capturing notes on the various technologies I use so that I can refer back to it in future.
2. To give myself some kind of presence on the web.

## Published using ![Jekyll icon]({{'/assets/images/brands/jekyll.svg' | relative_url}})

In January 2025 I decided to give my somewhat neglected site a bit of a refresh and started again using [Jekyll 3/4](https://jekyllrb.com/) and taking advantage of [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting (I say 3/4 as I'm running Jekyll 4 locallly but, at the time of writing, the GitHub pages action uses Jekyll 3).

Useful things I found

- Using [WSL to run Jekyll on Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/#installation-via-bash-on-windows-10) was actually straight forward (initially I tried to get away with just publishing to GitHub but eventually conceeded I would need to do more locally).
- Using the [jekyll-embed-video README](https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video) was great for getting YouTube involed without the need for plugins (while I'm on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)).

## Other stuff

- [freepik.com](http://www.freepik.com/) - Thanks, I've used a few images from there.
- [worldvectorlogo.com](https://worldvectorlogo.com) and [vectorlogo.zone](https://www.vectorlogo.zone) - For sourcing all the branding SVG files.
